#  arXiv plain text extraction

This service extracts plain text from arXiv PDFs. This is used during the
submission process as part of routine quality assurance checks. This is also
used after announcement, to update quality assurance tools (e.g. overlap
detection) and to make plain text content available to authorized API
consumers.
