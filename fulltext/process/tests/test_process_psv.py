**Pauli Virtanen** is SciPy's Benevolent Dictator For Life (BDFL).  He says:

*Truthfully speaking, we could have released a SciPy 1.0 a long time ago, so
I'm happy we do it now at long last. The project has a long history, and during
the years it has matured also as a software project.  I believe it has well
proved its merit to warrant a version number starting with unity.*

*Since its conception 15+ years ago, SciPy has largely been written by and for
scientists, to provide a box of basic tools that they need. Over time, the set
of people active in its development has undergone some rotation, and we have
evolved towards a somewhat more systematic approach to development.
Regardless, this underlying drive has stayed the same, and I think it will also
continue propelling the project forward in future. This is all good, since not
long after 1.0 comes 1.1.*
